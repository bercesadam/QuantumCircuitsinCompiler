|😾⟩, pronounced as “Ket Cat”, is fully `constexpr` C++ framework for simulating quantum systems: **logical quantum circuits** and **physical quantum mechanics** under a shared mathematical foundation.
The project was originally named *'|Ψ⟩CC — Quantum Circuits in Compiler'* and began as a quantum circuit simulator: the original goal was to compute the evolution of quantum state vectors in constexpr time using unitary gate operations. Formally, this corresponds to solving the Schrödinger equation in a finite-dimensional Hilbert space using discrete unitary operators:

$$
|\psi_{n+1}\rangle = U_n |\psi_n\rangle
$$

Since this is mathematically a special case of Schrödinger evolution under a piecewise-constant Hamiltonian, the existing linear algebra abstractions, state vector representations, and operator formalism naturally generalized to support the computation of time evolution of physical quantum systems described by the **time-dependent Schrödinger equation**:

$$
i\hbar \frac{\partial \psi(t)}{\partial t} = H(t)\psi(t)
$$

As a result, the project evolved from a quantum circuit simulator into a unified quantum simulation framework and capable of modeling both logical and physical quantum systems - currently supporting discretized, 1D cases. I have kept the original repo for historical purposes - the original |ψ⟩CC source code can be found under the tag v1.0, and hence I've kept also the original repo name even after the rebranding of the project.

## Conceptual Framework

This project is not intended to be a high-performance production simulator.  
Instead, it serves as:
* A conceptual bridge between **quantum circuits** and **physical quantum mechanics**
* A didactic framework for understanding quantum state evolution
* A demonstration of advanced **type-driven design** and **compile-time verification** in modern C++

At its core, |😾⟩ is built on a shared mathematical model:
* Complex-valued state vectors representing elements of a Hilbert space
* Linear operators acting on those states
* Explicit, unitary time evolution
* Easy to use API (see examples) both for circuit building and describing physical simulations

Within this framework, two complementary quantum models are supported. Both models reuse the same underlying types and abstractions; they differ only in how the evolution operators are constructed:

### Quantum Circuit Model

Discrete, gate-based evolution of logical qubits using unitary operators.
This corresponds to the standard circuit model of quantum computation with zero classically hard-coded gate logic.
Also provides a library of basic quantum gates and also a few examples (Bell and GHZ state, Shor's algorithm and my fair quantum dice circuit).

### Physical Quantum Mechanics Model

Numerical simulation of wavefunctions evolving under time-dependent Hamiltonians; a numerical PDE solver for the time-dependent Schrödinger equation.

Also provides a library of predefined, configurable seed wave functions (presenting quantum physics textbook examples, like eigenstates, Gaussian wave packets and Hydrogen orbitals); library and API to construct potential fields and potential barriers during Hamilton construction; and a 1D Particle-in-a-box system as a quantum playground. Also features an 1D oscilloscope-like visualization with phase encoding where you can witness a Schrödinger time evolution directly in a terminal, like how quantum tunneling works conceptually in SSD's or the radial nodes of a hydrogen atom’s electron cloud.

## C++ Design and Type-Level Guarantees

Beyond its mathematical foundations, the framework places strong emphasis on **type safety and compile-time correctness**, expoiting modern C++ language features extensively.

Key strengths from a C++ perspective include:

-   **Strong Type Safety**  
    Quantum states, operators, and systems are represented using distinct, explicit types.  
    Invalid compositions (e.g. applying incompatible operators or mismatched dimensions) are rejected at compile time rather than failing at runtime.
    
-   **Template-Based Dimensional Encoding**  
    Hilbert space dimensionality and system sizes are encoded directly in template parameters, enabling the compiler to enforce algebraic consistency across operations.
    
-   **Concepts and Compile-Time Constraints**  
    C++20 concepts are used to express mathematical requirements such as linearity, unitarity, and operator compatibility.  
    This makes the code self-documenting and prevents misuse of abstractions.
    
-   **Type Traits and Static Introspection**  
    Custom type traits are employed to reason about quantum objects at compile time, enabling conditional logic, specialization, and validation without runtime overhead.
    
-   **`constexpr` Evaluation and Zero Runtime Cost**  
    Where applicable, quantum state evolution and operator application can be fully evaluated at compile time, eliminating runtime cost and enabling aggressive compiler optimization.
    
-   **Clear Separation of Abstraction Layers**  
    The design cleanly separates:
    
    -   mathematical primitives,
        
    -   quantum evolution models,
        
    -   and system-level simulations  
        while still sharing a unified type system.
        

Together, these features make the framework not only a quantum simulation environment, but also a demonstration of advanced **type-driven design**, **metaprogramming**, and **compile-time verification** techniques in modern C++.

## Limitations

While |😾⟩ provides a unified and mathematically consistent framework for quantum simulation, several limitations should be noted:

**Not a High-Performance Simulator**
The framework prioritizes clarity, correctness, and type safety over raw performance.
It is not optimized for large-scale systems or production-level numerical workloads.

**Exponential State Growth**
As with all explicit state-vector simulations, memory and computational complexity scale exponentially with system size. This limits practical simulations to relatively small Hilbert spaces.

**Numerical Precision**
Physical quantum simulations rely on floating-point arithmetic and discretization. While stable integration schemes are used, numerical error accumulation is unavoidable for long time evolutions or fine spatial grids.

**Idealized Quantum Circuits**
The circuit model assumes ideal unitary operations and does not model noise, decoherence, or hardware-specific effects.

These limitations are deliberate design choices aligned with the project’s educational and exploratory goals.
